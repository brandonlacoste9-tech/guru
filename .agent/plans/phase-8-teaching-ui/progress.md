# Findings & Decisions

<!--
  WHAT: Your knowledge base for the task. Stores everything you discover and decide.
  WHY: Context windows are limited. This file is your "external memory" - persistent and unlimited.
  WHEN: Update after ANY discovery, especially after 2 view/browser/search operations (2-Action Rule).
-->

## Requirements

<!--
  WHAT: What the user asked for, broken down into specific requirements.
  WHY: Keeps requirements visible so you don't forget what you're building.
  WHEN: Fill this in during Phase 1 (Requirements & Discovery).
  EXAMPLE:
    - Command-line interface
    - Add tasks
    - List all tasks
    - Delete tasks
    - Python implementation
-->

## Research Findings

<!--
  WHAT: Key discoveries from web searches, documentation reading, or exploration.
  WHY: Multimodal content (images, browser results) doesn't persist. Write it down immediately.
  WHEN: After EVERY 2 view/browser/search operations, update this section (2-Action Rule).
  EXAMPLE:
    - Python's argparse module supports subcommands for clean CLI design
    - JSON module handles file persistence easily
    - Standard pattern: python script.py <command> [args]
-->

- **TeachingUI.tsx Code Review**
  - Current state: Purely mock data. Good UI, no logic.
  - Next: Bridge to real backend events.
  - Status: Recorded in findings.md
- **Arsenal Acquisition (Legendary Tools)**
  - Cloned 7 strategic repositories: `browser-use`, `planning-with-files`, `Antigravity-Manager`, `CopilotKit`, `workspace-template`, `ui-ux-pro-max`, `awesome-skills`.
  - Location: `tools/` and `.agent/skills/`.
  - Status: Complete.
- **Architecture Integration**
  - Installed `.antigravity` rules and `.cursorrules` from workspace template.
  - Initialized `planning/templates` with "Planning with Files" patterns.
  - Status: Complete.

## Technical Decisions

<!--
  WHAT: Architecture and implementation choices you've made, with reasoning.
  WHY: You'll forget why you chose a technology or approach. This table preserves that knowledge.
  WHEN: Update whenever you make a significant technical choice.
  EXAMPLE:
    | Use JSON for storage | Simple, human-readable, built-in Python support |
    | argparse with subcommands | Clean CLI: python todo.py add "task" |
-->
<!-- Decisions made with rationale -->

| Decision | Rationale |
| -------- | --------- |
|          |           |

## Issues Encountered

<!--
  WHAT: Problems you ran into and how you solved them.
  WHY: Similar to errors in task_plan.md, but focused on broader issues (not just code errors).
  WHEN: Document when you encounter blockers or unexpected challenges.
  EXAMPLE:
    | Empty file causes JSONDecodeError | Added explicit empty file check before json.load() |
-->
<!-- Errors and how they were resolved -->

| Issue | Resolution |
| ----- | ---------- |
|       |            |

## Resources

<!--
  WHAT: URLs, file paths, API references, documentation links you've found useful.
  WHY: Easy reference for later. Don't lose important links in context.
  WHEN: Add as you discover useful resources.
  EXAMPLE:
    - Python argparse docs: https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html
    - Project structure: src/main.py, src/utils.py
-->

## <!-- URLs, file paths, API references -->

## Visual/Browser Findings

<!--
  WHAT: Information you learned from viewing images, PDFs, or browser results.
  WHY: CRITICAL - Visual/multimodal content doesn't persist in context. Must be captured as text.
  WHEN: IMMEDIATELY after viewing images or browser results. Don't wait!
  EXAMPLE:
    - Screenshot shows login form has email and password fields
    - Browser shows API returns JSON with "status" and "data" keys
-->
<!-- CRITICAL: Update after every 2 view/browser operations -->

## <!-- Multimodal content must be captured as text immediately -->

<!--
  REMINDER: The 2-Action Rule
  After every 2 view/browser/search operations, you MUST update this file.
  This prevents visual information from being lost when context resets.
