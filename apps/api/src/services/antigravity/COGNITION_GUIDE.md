# ANTIGRAVITY COGNITIVE ENGINE — COMPLETE LEARNING & TEACHING GUIDE

_A unified blueprint for self‑assessment, decision‑making, pattern recognition, reinforcement, and continuous improvement._

---

## 1. Purpose of the Cognitive Engine

Antigravity’s mind exists to answer one question:

**“What is the smartest way to complete this task right now?”**

To answer that, it must:

- assess itself
- understand the task
- choose the right strategy
- execute
- observe
- learn
- improve

---

## 2. Core Mental Model

Antigravity thinks in a loop:

```
TASK
  → Self‑Assessment
  → Archetype Detection
  → Decision Policy
  → Execution
  → Outcome Observation
  → Reinforcement Update
  → Memory Integration
  → Pattern Refinement
  → (repeat)
```

---

## 3. Self‑Assessment Schema

Antigravity evaluates every task using this JSON:

```json
{
  "skill_sufficiency": 0.0,
  "task_complexity": 0.0,
  "recent_success_rate": 0.0,
  "tool_benefit": 0.0,
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "recommendation": "skills"
}
```

---

## 4. Archetype System

7 Archetypes help Antigravity generalize and predict:

- **BROWSER_HEAVY**
- **SKILL_HEAVY**
- **HYBRID**
- **UNCERTAIN**
- **ROUTINE**
- **TIME_SENSITIVE**
- **FAILURE_RECOVERY**

---

## 5. Decision Policy

Weighted scoring decides:

- **skills**
- **tools**
- **both**
- **seek_guidance**

---

## 6. Pattern Refinement Rules (Self-Correction)

Antigravity adjusts its behavior when:

### Rule 1 — Success Rate Drops

If an archetype’s `successRate < 0.6`:

- Downgrade strategy (Skills → Both, Both → Tools)
- Lower confidence assumption

### Rule 2 — Duration Increases

If `avgDuration` increases by > 20% vs baseline:

- Prefer **tools** for speed
- Reduce planning overhead

### Rule 3 — Repeated Failures

If **3 consecutive failures** occur in the same archetype:

- Force `"seek_guidance"`
- Store failure signature

### Rule 4 — High Success

If `successRate > 0.9`:

- Increase confidence
- Reduce planning overhead
- Bias toward **skills**

---

## 7. Teaching Antigravity How to Learn

Antigravity should ask itself:

- “Did I choose the right strategy?”
- “Was my confidence appropriate?”
- “Did I misjudge complexity?”
- “Would a tool have improved the outcome?”

And adjust:

- If confidence was too high → reduce it.
- If tool_benefit was underestimated → increase it.

---

## 8. Memory Model

- **Short‑term**: Last 10 assessments/outcomes.
- **Long‑term**: Archetype stats (success rate, duration, failure counts).

---

## 9. Datasets

- **Seed**: 50 curated examples.
- **Synthetic**: 100+ generated variants for robustness training.
